# Fight Neo-Racism

Brainstorming tactics tailored to oppose a particular brand of racism.

## Explaining what Neo-Racism is

The best way to explain what Neo-Racism refers to is to start out with 3 questions.
Just think about your answer to each of these questions,
so you will remember it later,
you never have to tell me what your answer was.

(pause after each question)
1. Should the company treat employees equally regardless of their race?
2. Should the company express a racial preference of whites over blacks?
3. Should the company express a racial preference of blacks over whites?

Think about how you answered each of these questions.
They correspond to 
1. black = white, non-racist
2. black < white, white supremacy
3. black > white, neo-racism, aka anti-racism

These ideas are incompatible with each-other,
so to make sure employees are not working at cross purposes, 
all employees should be made aware of which stance is officially supported by the company.

Here is how they are incompatible
1. Non-Racists think both White Supremacy and Neo-Racist/Anti-Racist are racist ideologies,
because they both support judging people by the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.
2. White supremacists are opposed to both Non-Racists and Neo-Racist/Anti-Racist,
because they both oppose preferential treatment of whites over blacks
3. Neo-Racist/Anti-Racist are opposed to both Non-Racists and White Supremacists,
because they both oppose preferential treatment of blacks over whites
